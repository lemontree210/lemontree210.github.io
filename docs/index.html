                </h2>

                
                

                <p>One of my goals recently has been to try and automate some of my PC routines.
I didn't think it was possible at all, but then <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lena-shakurova/">Lena Shakurova</a>
wrote/spoke about <a href="https://n8n.io/">n8n.io</a>, so I decided to try it.</p>
<p>Now, n8n.io has no free plan as of June 2025, just a short trial period of a paid plan.
But that's if you use their cloud to store your project. But you can run a self-hosted version for free.
(Well, you still need some investment, but we'll get to that later.)</p>
<h2>What n8n already has in their docs when it comes to deployment</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are some instructions on server setup listed in the
<a href="https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/server-setups/">official docs</a>.</li>
<li>There is a <a href="https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit">repo</a> where you can download a self-hosted AI starter kit.</li>
</ul>
<p>I found no simple instructions for setting up n8n without docker compose, that I'm not yet fully
familiar with, and on just some random web server, not Digital Ocean or AWS.</p>
<p>So I thought that I would figure it out, learning basics of Docker along the way
and refreshing my memory of what a reverse proxy actually is because I'm going to need it.</p>
<h2>Important concepts</h2>
<p>Ok, here's what I needed to learn/know/understand in order to run n8n on my own server:</p>
<h3>Docker</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nana-janashia/">Nana Janashia</a> made an 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg19Z8LL06w">incredibly helpful intro</a> to Docker
(just take a moment to look at the view count, it's more than many music and standup videos!).
There was all I needed to know: basically, a Docker container is a thing that uses your
operating system (Linux for vast majority of servers) and puts an application layer on top of it.
You have to get a Docker <em>image</em>, which contains the setup of this application layer, and create
a <em>container</em> where it will be installed and run.</p>
<h3>Nginx as a reverse proxy</h3>
<p>I had already known something about nginx. Just in case: it's a web server, i.e. a program that
runs on the remote server and answers HTTP(S) requests. I know that there are configuration files
you have to create in the right places. But what was also important to refresh in my memory was
that nginx acts as a <em>reverse proxy</em>, and this is relevant for serving n8n (or any other app?).</p>
<p>A "normal" proxy is what you could use on your own computer to access some web resources. It sits 
between your computer and the web server you're trying to access. So, a reverse proxy does
the thing in the opposite direction: it receives a request on some port that is exposed to the
internet, and then forwards it to (in my case) an app that is listening to some other port.
That other port is not exposed to the internet. This way nginx handles all incoming requests,
improving security.</p>
<h2>Setting up</h2>
<h3>Install and start Docker and NGINX</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">    </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>update
<span class="w">    </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>docker.io

</code></pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">    </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>nginx<span class="w"> </span>
<span class="w">    </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>systemctl<span class="w"> </span>start<span class="w"> </span>nginx<span class="w"> </span>
<span class="w">    </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>systemctl<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">enable</span><span class="w"> </span>nginx
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Make sure you keep nginx and Docker up to date in your system.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Set up a certificate for your domain</h3>
<p>This is the investment bit :)
n8n will rightfully complain without https, so we need an SSL certificate.</p>
<p>The investment is not in a certificate as it can be generated for free, but in a domain name
you will generate the certificate for.</p>
<p>So, once the domain name is set up to forward to your server, let's generate a Let's Encrypt certificate.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">    </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>certbot<span class="w"> </span>python3-certbot-nginx<span class="w"> </span>
<span class="w">    </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>certbot<span class="w"> </span>--nginx<span class="w"> </span>-d<span class="w"> </span>your-domain.com<span class="w"> </span>-d<span class="w"> </span>www.your-domain.com
</code></pre></div>

<p>Certbot will update your NGINX config to use HTTPS and redirect HTTP to HTTPS.</p>
<h3>Create a Docker Volume for n8n Data</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">  </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>docker<span class="w"> </span>volume<span class="w"> </span>create<span class="w"> </span>n8n_data
</code></pre></div>

<p>n8n will use it as persistent storage so that your data remains intact
even if you delete the container</p>
<h3>Start the n8n Container</h3>
<p>As Nana Janashia explains in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg19Z8LL06w">her Docker crash course</a>,
you can either first <em>pull</em> the image from a remote registry and then <em>run</em> it, but you can just
say <code>docker run</code> and, if there is no local image, it will pull it for you.
Also, you don't have to specify where to pull it from, because n8n.io has images uploaded
to the official registry, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/n8nio/n8n">Docker Hub</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">  </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>docker<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="w"> </span>-d<span class="w"> </span>--restart<span class="w"> </span>unless-stopped<span class="w"> </span>--name<span class="w"> </span>n8n<span class="w"> </span>-p<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">5678</span>:5678<span class="w"> </span>-v<span class="w"> </span>n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n<span class="w"> </span>docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:stable
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let's break down the parameters of <code>docker run</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-d</code>: Run container in detached mode (in the background)</li>
<li><code>--restart unless-stopped</code>: Automatically restart the container unless explicitly stopped</li>
<li><code>--name n8n</code>: Name the container "n8n" for easier reference. It's much easier to use the name, not the ID.</li>
<li><code>-p 5678:5678</code>: Map port 5678 on the host to port 5678 in the container. As Nana says, it's good practice to preserve the port number that the app is using by default. Note that when I say "map port 5678" on the host, I mean <code>localhost</code> on my webserver. It will be accessed internally by nginx, not from the outside using browsers!</li>
<li><code>-v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n</code>: Attach the volume for data persistence that we created earlier.</li>
<li><code>docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:stable</code>: The Docker image to use (official n8n image from Docker Hub). I'm using the tag <code>stable</code> here, you can use a different one.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Configure NGINX as a Reverse Proxy</h3>
<p>Edit or create the NGINX configuration file (you can put anything instead of <code>n8n</code>, of course):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">  </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>nano<span class="w"> </span>/etc/nginx/sites-available/n8n
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here are directives that must be in the configuration file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">server</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="err">listen</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">443</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">ssl</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">listen</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="cp">[</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="cp">]</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">443</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">ssl</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="err">server_name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">your-domain.com</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">www.your-domain.com</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="err">ssl_certificate</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">/etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="err">ssl_certificate_key</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">/etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="err">include</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">/etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="err">ssl_dhparam</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">/etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="err">location</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">/</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">{</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="err">proxy_pass</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">http</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">localhost</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">5678</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="err">proxy_set_header</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">Host</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">$host</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="err">proxy_set_header</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">X-Forwarded-For</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="err">proxy_set_header</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">X-Forwarded-Proto</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">$scheme</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Note that the <code>location /</code> block is where we set up this reverse proxying. 
<code>proxy_pass</code> tells nginx to forward incoming requests that came to port <code>443</code>
(standard port for https) to port <code>5678</code> on <code>localhost</code>.
Which is the port that n8n is listening to.</p>
<h3>Enable the NGINX Configuration</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">  </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>ln<span class="w"> </span>-s<span class="w"> </span>/etc/nginx/sites-available/n8n<span class="w"> </span>/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now this part confused me a bit, but after a while it makes sense.
You create a site configuration in <code>sites-available</code> and it just sits there.
But when you decide to actually use this site, you <em>enable</em> it by creating a symlink
(like a shortcut, so you don't the file itself) in <code>sites-enabled</code>.
nginx tries to serve only sites that are <em>enabled</em>, not all sites that are simply <em>available</em>.</p>
<h3>Check NGINX Configuration</h3>
<p>This will return errors if something is wrong with the config file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">  </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>nginx<span class="w"> </span>-t
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Open Port 443 in the Firewall</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">  </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>ufw<span class="w"> </span>allow<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">443</span>/tcp
<span class="w">  </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>ufw<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">enable</span>
<span class="w">  </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>ufw<span class="w"> </span>status
</code></pre></div>

<p>Remember that we do <strong>not</strong> open port <code>5678</code> because it's for internal use.</p>
<h3>Restart NGINX</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">  </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>systemctl<span class="w"> </span>restart<span class="w"> </span>nginx<span class="sb">`</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Test Your Setup</h3>
<p>Access n8n via your domain. You should see the n8n login or setup page.</p>
<h2>Diagnostics: in case something doesn't work</h2>
<h3>Check which processes are listening on ports <code>443</code> and <code>5678</code></h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">  </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>ss<span class="w"> </span>-tulnp<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>grep<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">443</span>
<span class="w">  </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>ss<span class="w"> </span>-tulnp<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>grep<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">5678</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It should say "nginx" for port 443 and "docker-proxy" (that's n8n) for port 5678.</p>
<h3>Check  NGINX configuration for errors</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">  </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>nginx<span class="w"> </span>-t
</code></pre></div>

<p>Tests NGINX configuration syntax.</p>
<h3>Check  NGINX service status</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">  </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>systemctl<span class="w"> </span>status<span class="w"> </span>nginx
</code></pre></div>

<p>Shows if NGINX is running and recent logs.</p>
<h3>Check NGINX error messages in real time</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">  </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>tail<span class="w"> </span>-f<span class="w"> </span>/var/log/nginx/error.log
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Check running Docker containers</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo<span class="w"> </span>docker<span class="w"> </span>ps
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Check Docker container logs</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo<span class="w"> </span>docker<span class="w"> </span>logs<span class="w"> </span>n8n
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Check  firewall rules</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo<span class="w"> </span>ufw<span class="w"> </span>status
</code></pre></div>

<p>Port 443 should be open.</p>
                <div class="clear"></div>

<p><em>This text was inspired by the section "<a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/neural-networks/activation-functions">Activation functions</a>" in Google's Machine Learning Crash Course and <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/">a blog post</a> mentioned in that section. I decided to explain the rationale of all this to myself.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's say we have a number of features and a binary classification task (e.g. whether a house will be sold, based on two features: its price and area). In case of two features, we can visualize them on a 2D graph and the task would be to calculate a formula for a straight line that separates our two classes. We do so by multiplying each value of a feature by a certain floating point number (<em>weight</em>) and then adding some floating point scalar number to the whole graph equation (that basically lifts or lowers the line on our graph), which is called <em>bias</em>. We get a straight line that has some slope (determined by weights) and crosses Y axis in some point (determined by bias). </p>
<p>(If we have three features, then instead of a straight line, we get a plane. For more than 3 features, we get a hyperplane.)</p>
<p>In many cases there is no straight line that can separate instances of two classes. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/9781788830577/files/assets/c608dc6d-58f1-4548-b5d7-f3ba22fe1709.png">

<p>To try and fix this, we can produce <em>a feature cross</em>, for example multiplying [square of] one feature by [square of] another (it is possible, since all features, even categorical ones, are represented as numbers). We still have a linear equation, but the line now looks curvy (or it's a hyperbolic line, so looks like two separate curvy lines). Since the equation is still linear, we can imagine that in a space with more dimensions, there is a perfectly flat plane or hyperplane separating two original features. We can try and create feature crosses by hand, adjusting weights now not only for original features, but for their crosses as well.</p>

<em>This feature cross works well. Screenshot from <a href="https://playground.tensorflow.org">TensorFlow Playground</a></em></p>
<p>But feature crosses aren't enough for complex dependencies.</p>
<p><img alt="Feature cross" src="https://lemontree210.github.io/images/featurecross2.jpg" title="Feature cross">
<em>Here, a feature cross doesn't work well. Screenshot from <a href="https://playground.tensorflow.org">TensorFlow Playground</a></em></p>
<p>Just like we previously asked the model to figure out the weights and bias on its own, we can now ask it to create abstract combinations of features on its own as well and see if it helps separate data points.</p>
<p>This process can't be done with a simple model layout of one input layer and one output layer. So we create "hidden" layers, in which our model creates abstract interactions between inputs, adjusts their weights, adds bias, feeds them to subsequent hidden layers where new abstractions are created, and so on.</p>
<p>(If our features can be separated by one continuous function, one hidden layer will always be enough, as long as it has enough neurons. But even then we might choose to have multiple layers for efficiency. To work with hierarchical structures, e.g. put together edges into shapes, then shapes into objects that we need to recognize in an image, we definitely need multiple hidden layers.)</p>
<p>Okay, so we have added some layers. Despite our space of features now being multidimensional and transformations looking very complex, without an additional operation its predictions will only work with linear dependencies between features.</p>
<p>To address this problem, at each layer we introduce a function called <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function">activation function</a></em>. The model takes the bias summed with all products of values and weights and feeds them to this function. If the activation function is non-linear, our model gets the ability to work with non-linear dependencies.</p>
<p>Popular examples of activation functions are Sigmoid (more correctly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">logistic</a>, since "sigmoid" is too general a term; produces values between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>), <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tanh-activation-in-neural-network/">tanh</a> (short for "hyperbolic tangent"; also an S-shaped function, like sigmoid, and produces values between <code>-1</code> and <code>1</code>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)">ReLU</a> (short for "Rectified Linear Unit", produces <code>0</code> for negative values and preserves original value for positive ones). Usually, the same activation function is applied to all hidden layers, then a task-specific function (could be same, could be different) is applied to outputs of the last hidden layer to produce the final output of the model.</p>

<p>ReLU is often favored over sigmoid and tanh because it can be computed faster and avoids the so-called "vanishing gradient" problem (vanishing gradients occur when small weight updates during training make the model stop learning). There is, however, a <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/neural-networks/backpropagation#dead_relu_units">"Dead ReLU Units" problem</a>.</p>
<p>Now our model creates and weighs certain combinations of inputs (much more abstract equivalents of a feature cross we would add manually in our simple model). Before moving on to the next layer, the model applies an activation function.</p>
<p>In the process, the model warps and reshapes our space of feature values, sometimes even tearing it apart (scientifically speaking, breaking its topology). Our model strives to create a certain multidimensional space where data points will all be separated by a "straight line", i.e. where the equation finally becomes linear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A side note: when I say "warps and reshapes our space", it could imply some sort of distortion. However, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold_hypothesis">the manifold hypothesis</a>, it's the other way round: a neural network "unfolds" a "manifold", which is a lower-dimensional structure embedded in high-dimensional space, like a crumpled paper in 3D, to produce a linearly separable representation.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that in the picture above, where we see some sort of parallelogram, it's actually a hyperplane in a higher-dimensional space.</p>
<p>Here is a beautiful visualization from <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/">this blog post</a>, where two spirals are getting separated from each other after some "warping and reshaping" of the space:</p>

<p>And now, the final step. When, after much learning, a multidimensional space is created, in which data points are more or less successfully separated, a task-dependent activation function (e.g. sigmoid for binary classification, softmax for multi-class) is applied one last time. It converts the linear separation in the transformed space into a probabilistic output, ensuring the output is interpretable. This is the prediction we asked for.</p>
