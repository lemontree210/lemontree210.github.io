Title: Creating documentation for my project with AI in one hour

I have a Python library called `tinybear` that contains all simple tools I have used to work with files in different formats. It is [published](https://pypi.org/project/tinybear) on `pypi`.

I was too lazy to write a blog post about publishing my project, but, in a nutshell, [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) makes these things rather easy.

Now, while moving in a direction of project management in IT, and also getting a referral for a technical writer role, I decided, it was time to create at least some simple documentation for `tinybear`.

Today it took me about an hour to get this done using [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) and [Qodo](https://www.qodo.ai/) (this is not an advert). I used Perplexity to research options for creating documentation and then Qodo in my IDE to suggest additions/changes to project files.

## Choose an approach

I chose the approach that is considered the simplest one: MkDocs + GitHub pages. Sphinx is not needed for simple projects.

I already have GitHub Pages (you know that since you're here), so `tinybear` documentation cannot just be at `https://lemontree210.github.io`. I thought it would be a problem, but turns out I can easily deploy my docs to a "subdirectory" (in my case, `https://lemontree210.github.io/tinybear/`).

## Change settings of the repo

The GitHub Action we're going to set up will need to create and write to a separate branch, which is common practice for hosting docs on GitHub pages.

The action will fail if repo workflow permissions are set to read only.

So at `https://github.com/[user]/[repo]/settings/actions` you need to scroll down to "Workflow permissions" and choose "Read and write permissions".

## Set up mkdocs

If you use `poetry`:
```shell
poetry add mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

Or with `pip`:
```shell
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

Create initial files by running from within the project directory:

```shell
mkdocs new .
```

This will create `mkdocs.yml` (configuration file) and `docs/index.md` (documentation homepage).

My configuration file looks as follows (adapted from [this tutorial](https://krython.com/tutorial/python/documentation-sphinx-and-mkdocs/)):

```yaml
site_name: TinyBear Documentation
site_url: https://lemontree210.github.io/tinybear/
extra:
  base_url: /tinybear/
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - Getting Started: getting_started.md
  - Usage: usage.md
  - API Reference: api.md
docs_dir: docs
site_dir: site
theme:
  name: material
  features:
    - navigation.instant  # ⚡ Instant loading
    - navigation.tracking  # 📊 Track scroll position
    - navigation.tabs.sticky  # 📌 Sticky navigation
    - navigation.top  # ⬆️ Back to top button
    - search.suggest  # 🔍 Search suggestions
    - search.share  # 🔗 Share search
    - header.autohide  # 🎩 Auto-hide header
    - content.code.annotate  # 💡 Code annotations
```

## Create actual documentation

I used Qodo to amend `index.md` and create MarkDown files for "Getting Started", "Usage" and "API Reference", which are standard sections of any documentation.

## Check locally
 
```shell
mkdocs serve
```

Starts a local server so you can look at the docs before pushing to the remote repo.

## Set up GitHub Action

I created `deploy.yml` in `.github/workflows` directory:

```yaml
name: Deploy MkDocs to GitHub Pages (gh-pages branch)

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: 3.x
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
      - name: Build docs
        run: |
          mkdocs build --site-dir site
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_branch: gh-pages
          publish_dir: ./site
```

## Set up Pages for the repo

In Settings -> Pages (`https://github.com/[user]/[repo]/settings/pages`) you need to set up deployment with "Source" set to "Deploy from a branch" and "Branch" set to `gh-pages` and directory within this branch set to `/root`. As you can see in YAML configuration above, the `gh-pages` branch will be used as source for GitHub pages. So, the Action takes what's on `master` now, puts it into `gh-pages` and GitHub Pages take content from there.

## Test online

Since I don't push directly to `master`, I had a separate branch for introducing this new feature. Obviously, I want to see whether GitHub Pages render the docs fine before. So I **temporarily** amend the `deploy.yml`, replacing the first line as follows:

```yaml

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - feat/add-mkdocs  # this is the branch from which I created a PR to merge the branch into master
```

Then, after pushing to this branch, you can check status of your actions in "Actions" section at `https://github.com/[user]/[repo]/actions`.

If actions run fine and you see that GitHub pages renders the docs (in my case at `https://lemontree210.github.io/tinybear/`), remember to **revert the change in branch name** back to `master` (or `main` if your repo has `main` as main branch).

## Merge your PR

And check Actions to make sure they ran, then refresh docs page to make sure the documentation is shown.

## Publish on PyPi

With `poetry`, I first updated pyproject.toml to include links to docs:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "tinybear"
version = "0.0.1"
description = "Where you don't need pandas yet. Tools to work with TXT, CSV, HTML, XLSX etc."
documentation = "https://lemontree210.github.io/tinybear/"
# ...

[tool.poetry.urls]
Homepage = "https://github.com/lemontree210/tinybear"
Documentation = "https://lemontree210.github.io/tinybear/"
```

and then ran:
```shell
poetry build
poetry publish
```

Now on PyPi I can see links to my documentation in a sidebar.
